# Optoelectronic neural network vs FPGA neural network
This project keep all my result obtained from thesis work.
The project is divided in three section:
- Optoelectronic implementation
- FPGA implementation
- Documentation
 <br />
To install and use the files check the **NOTE.txt** file inside each implementation part (Optoelectronic implementation or FPGA implementation).
To understand the project and see the result read the **thesis.pdf** file inside **Documentation** folder.
