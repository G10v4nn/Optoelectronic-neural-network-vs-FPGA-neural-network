The process followed to create a working FPGA neural network is:
1. Simulate the network on Python
2. Extract the settings of the network
3. Create the FPGA neural network on Vivado
4. Setup the FPGA NN with the settings founded in the python simulation

The software version used are Vivado 2021.2 and Torch (a python library)2.0.1.
